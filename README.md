## About DELIMITER in MySQL

- When creating stored procedures or functions in MySQL, we often need to write multiple SQL statements inside a single block (BEGIN ... END).
- By default, MySQL ends a command when it sees a semicolon (;).
- If we keep the default delimiter, MySQL will think the procedure ends too early (after the first ;).
- DELIMITER lets us temporarily change the command-ending symbol (e.g., to // or $$) so the entire block is treated as one single command.
- After the procedure/function is created, we switch back to the default ;.
